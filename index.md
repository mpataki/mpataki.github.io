# About

Hi, I'm Mat.

This site is about the stuff I'm interested in.  This focus on self is a bit weird for me but I'm going to get over that eventually.  

I write code every day and support my family doing it.  It's the best and I love it.  It's truly a vocation.

I've always been fortunate to have a wide set of interests.  Truth is, I'd be happy in many careers.  As my friends and family know, I'm always up for a good project.  Need to fix some home appliance?  I'm in.  Build a deck?  Fell a tree?  Wire something up?  I'm down, let's go.

There's something about pressing your brain against things you don't understand that feels like fulfilling the equipment's purpose.  I find it exciting.  Figuring things out feels like leveling up, and I like that.

This site should evolve into a collection of interesting topics explored.  If you take the time to read, I hope you enjoy.

~ Mat
